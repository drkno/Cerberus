Icom PCR1000 Radio control program. Designed to use the unofficial C# PCR1000 wrapper API.

Supports all the same features as the origional default IC-PCR1000 program that was used with the receiver (unfinished).
Also supports automatic satalite pass control and network control (nearly finished).

All pull requests welcome.
